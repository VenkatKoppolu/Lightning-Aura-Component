# SFDX App
LightningSystemLibrary is a Lightning App designed to show the salesforce provided lightning components library with examples.
1. lightning:avatar
A lightning:avatar component is an image that represents an object, such as an account or user. By default, the image renders in medium sizing with a rounded rectangle, which is also known as the square variant.

3. lightning:accordion
A lightning:accordion component groups related content in a single container. Only one accordion section is expanded at a time by default. When you select a section, it's expanded or collapsed. Set allowMultipleSectionsOpen to allow more than one section to be opened. Each section can hold one or more Lightning components.

5. lightning:button
Represents a button element.

6. lightning:buttonGroup
A lightning:buttonGroup component represents a set of buttons that can be displayed together to create a navigational bar. The body of the component can contain lightning:button or lightning:buttonMenu. If navigational tabs are needed, use lightning:tabset instead of lightning:buttonGroup.

7. lightning:buttonIcon
A lightning:buttonIcon component represents an icon-only button element that executes an action in a controller. Clicking the button triggers the client-side controller method set for onclick.

You can use a combination of the variant, size, class, and iconClass attributes to customize the button and icon styles. To customize styling on the button container, use the class attribute. For the bare variant, the size class applies to the icon itself. For non-bare variants, the size class applies to the button. To customize styling on the icon element, use the iconClass attribute. This example creates an icon-only button with bare variant and custom icon styling.

8. lightning:buttonIconStatefull
A lightning:buttonIconStateful component represents an icon-only button element that toggles between two states. For example, you can use this component for capturing a customer's feedback on a blog post (like or dislike). Clicking the button triggers the client-side controller method set for onclick and changes the state of the icon using the selected attribute.
